            - The opponent will now call you a liar if you make too high of a jump between bets. This is to prevent you from going:
               - 3 Two's -> 4 Fours -> 8 Sixes
            - The opponent will also call you a liar sooner.

Updates:

> Fixed a bug that made dice not reshuffle properly.
> Fixed a bug where you couldn't play after a game, even if you enter 'y' when prompted.

> Code cannot be run in a codespace, due to github codespaces not recognizing #include <gtest/gtest.h>.
